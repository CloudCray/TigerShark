TigerShark is an X12 EDI message parser that can be tailored to
a specific partner in the health care payment ecosystem.

It contains a test directory, tools and a demo web application that does
a little bit of claim display and edit.

This does not (currently) have a proper Python ``setup.py`` script for installation,
since this is such a random mixture of components.

It's probably best to include a ``.pth`` file in your ``lib/site-packages``
that references this working directory.
